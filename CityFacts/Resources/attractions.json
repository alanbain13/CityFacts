Whereas an ordinary maison (house) was built as part of a row, sharing party walls with the houses on either side and directly fronting on a street, an h\u00f4tel particulier was often free-standing, and by the 18th century it would always be located entre cour et jardin: that is, between the entrance court, the cour d'honneur, and the garden behind."
